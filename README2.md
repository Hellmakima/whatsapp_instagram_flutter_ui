## Installation

You'll need flutter SDK. I used the latest in March 2024.  
Also add ur own assets. (obviously) (6 images(jpg or jpeg), 2 videos(mp4))  
The project is implemented static. there is no external data used, all info is stored in List<List\<dynamic>>.  
There is a video player dependency. run this:
  ```flutter pub add video_player```
  #pubspec.yaml will update automatically

## Features
- **Home**: Displays main chat list.
- **Reels**: Shows video reel content.
- **Calls**: Manages call functionalities.

## Usage

setup Android studio or VS.  
Make a new project and shove this all in project > lib.  Don't forget the video_player from [Installation](#installation)  
Make 'assets' folder in project directory.  In pubspec.yaml add the asset 
  ```- assets/```
Thats it. Just run it and hope for the best. If the gods of coding are happy with u, u should see a running app.
